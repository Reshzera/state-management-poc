# Redux state management POC

Small Vite + React app demonstrating global state with Redux Toolkit. The count
and note live in a single slice so every panel stays in sync.

## Scripts

- `yarn dev` - start the Vite dev server
- `yarn build` - type-check then build for production
- `yarn lint` - run eslint
- `yarn preview` - preview the production build
